# Lending Policy – Simplified

## 1. Revenue and Trading History

We prefer businesses with:
- Annual revenue above £150,000.
- At least 3 full years of trading history.
Applications below these thresholds may still be considered but will be treated as higher risk.

## 2. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

To be eligible for standard approval:
- The debt-to-income ratio should generally be below 0.45.
- Ratios above 0.55 are typically considered too risky and are likely to be declined.

## 3. Credit Behaviour and Late Payments

Applicants with repeated late payments or recent defaults may:
- Be declined, or
- Offered reduced credit limits at higher scrutiny.

## 4. Sector Risk

High-risk sectors (e.g. highly cyclical or with weak regulatory oversight) may require:
- Stronger revenue history,
- Lower leverage,
- More conservative lending limits.

## 5. Requested Amount

Requested amounts that are disproportionately large relative to revenue or trading history are unlikely to be approved without additional security or guarantees.
